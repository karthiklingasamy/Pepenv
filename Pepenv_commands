# Step 1 :To Install Pepenv

# Step 2 : navigate to your project folder (RosterProject)

# Step 3: Install the required packages for you project

Note:Below are the important details to note after run the above command

Creating a virtualenv for this project…
Pipfile: C:\Karthik\roster_simulator\Pipfile
Using C:/Users/lkart/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python39/python.exe (3.9.0) 
Virtualenv location: C:\Users\lkart\.virtualenvs\roster_simulator-7Jh00s2y
Creating a Pipfile for this project…
Pipfile.lock not found, creating…
To activate this project's virtualenv, run pipenv shell.
Alternatively, run a command inside the virtualenv with pipenv run.

pip file:
It is TOML file. It contains different section. With key and value pair

# To install additional package
go to command path C:\Users\lkart\.virtualenvs\roster_simulator-7Jh00s2y\Scripts
>pip install Appium-Python-Client

# step 4: Activate virtual Environment
$ pipenv shell
Launching subshell in virtual environment…

# step 5: To shee which python is used and to see which venv is used
> python
> import sys
> sys.executable

# Step 6: To deactivate the environment
>exit

# Step 7: To tun command without activate the venv
>pipenv run python
>import sys
>sys.executable

# To run scripts without activate out project
> pipenv run python New_RMS_DeploymentRoster_api_Dev.py

# Step 8: How to install multiple package at a time using requirement.txt
> pipenv install -r ../snippets/requirements.txt

# Step 8: How to generate requirement.txt or piplock file
>pipenv lock -r

# How to install pytest packages only in dev environment
>pipenv install pytest --dev

# How to uninstall packages
>pipenv uninstall requests

# Step 9: How to create new virtual enviroment using python 3.8 (current venv is used python 3.9)
Note:Before run the below cmd go to pipfile and change the python version and save the file
> pipenv --python 3.8

# How to remove the environment completely and recreate from scratch using pip file. if you pip file and environment is not in sync better remove the environment and create new enviroment
Note: Now i want to use python 3.9 so go to pip fle and change the python version and save

To remove venv:
C:\Karthik\roster_simulator>pipenv --rm

Note: This will only remove the venv now everything we need to recreate the environment is in our pip file. so to create the environment that match in our pip file is run the below command

>C:\Karthik\roster_simulator>pipenv install
Note: pipfile should be thate in the

# Step 10: How to find the venv path
>C:\Karthik\roster_simulator>pipenv --venv

38107: bleach <=3.1.3 resolved (3.1.3 installed)!
The ``bleach.clean`` behavior parsing style attributes in bleach before 3.1.4 could result in a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). Calls to ``bleach.clean`` with an allowed tag with an allowed ``style`` attribute were vulnerable to ReDoS. For example, ``bleach.clean(..., attributes={'a': ['style']})``.  This issue was confirmed in Bleach versions v3.1.3, v3.1.2, v3.1.1, v3.1.0, v3.0.0, v2.1.4, and v2.1.3. Earlier versions used a similar regular expression and should be considered vulnerable too.

# To fix the security issue (Video Time: 22:00) for more details
Install latest latest package
